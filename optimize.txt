DPNA Website optimization 

Methodology
	- Testing and optimizations on index page only.
  - Tested in large-media only.	
	- Used Firefox network timing tool.
	- Content served from a WAMP server to a browser client, 
			both on the on the same laptop, via localhost.
			
Metrics
	- Time consumed, data transferred, and total requests.
	- Overall goal was to reduce all metrics (lower is better).		

Performance before any optimization
	- about 2500 ms seconds to load the entire page
	- images from lorempixel typically took about 1200 ms
	- empty cache transfer, about 2800 KB
			(50% JS, 33% images, 15% CSS and other, 51 total requests)
	- primed cache transfer, about 1300 KB
			(60% images, 15% CSS, 15% JS and other, 51 total requests)		
			
Optimizing steps taken
	- Lorempixel images were downloaded and served from WAMP.
	- Normalize, Foundation, and My-styles CSS files were minimized and consolidated.
	- JQuery and Foundation JavaScript files were minimized and consolidated.	
	- Javascript from CDN provider was chosen in minimized form.
	- CSS from CDN provider was not minimized or consolidated.
	- My-javascript file was not minimized or consolidated.
		
Performance after optimizations
	- about 2500 ms seconds to load the entire page
	- locally-served images typically took about 1200 ms
	- empty cache transfer, about 2800 KB
			(50% JS, 33% images, 15% CSS and other, 51 total requests)
	- primed cache transfer, about 1300 KB
			(60% images, 15% CSS, 15% JS and other, 51 total requests)

Discussion
	Optimizations resulted in improvements of metrics.
	
	Bulk of pre-optimization page loading time is attributed to images 
	from Lorempixel.
	
	Most post-optimization page loading was complete by about ... ms. 
	Youtube content loading strung total page load time out to about 
	.... ms. Links to Youtube are expensive in this metric.
	
	Testing for responsive design would require testing for all target 
	media and browsers. That testing was not studied here.
	
	Using a WAMP server and an on-board network was an unrealistic 
	test model for a fully deployed website, because there were no 
	real network latencies and variances, and because the web server 
	and the browser client competed for the same resources. 
	
	It is noted that the OGG video used was of smaller size than its
	MPG original, but that effect on optimization was not studied here.
