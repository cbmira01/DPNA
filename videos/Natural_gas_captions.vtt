These conventional resources represent only a part of the natural gas that's available to us. 

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Natural gas also occurs in places that are more difficult to develop and more expensive to produce. 

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
These occurrences known as unconventional resources include tight gas, coalbed methane, deep gas, and methane hydrates. 

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Together these have the potential of providing large amounts of natural gas for the future.

Tight gas occurs in rocks like the massive sandstones that form the cliffs of Mesa Verde National Park in southwestern Colorado. 

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Farther south these same layers lie buried beneath thousands of feet of rock in the San Juan Basin. 

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Here they house vast stores of natural gas but hold it tightly locked in isolated cells. 

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Pores in these tight gas reservoirs are unconnected like holes in a Swiss cheese or linked only by microscopic cracks. 

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The gas moves slowly through the rock or not at all, making it difficult to collect, 

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
but large natural fractures crack open the pore space, freeing the gas.

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Zones of intensely fractured rock form concentrations of natural gas. 

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
New technologies let drillers pierce these zones horizontally, 

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
tapping several from a single well and making the difficult job of recovery more efficient.

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Tight gas sandstones hold immense quantities of natural gas, 

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
but much of it may be too expensive or even impossible to recover, 

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
yet reasoned estimates suggest that tight gas might supply four hundred trillion cubic feet of natural gas, 

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
enough to meet our present needs for twenty years.
