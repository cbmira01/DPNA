00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
[intro...]

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
The heart is a bloom

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Shoots up through the stony ground

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
There's no room

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
No space to rent in this town

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
You're out of luck

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
And the reason that you had to care

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
The traffic is stuck

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
And you're not moving anywhere

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
You thought you'd found a friend

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
To take you out of this place

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
Someone you could lend a hand

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
In return for grace

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
It's a beautiful day

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Sky falls you feel like

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
It's a beautiful day

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Don't let it get away

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
You're on the road

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
But you've got no destination

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
You're in the mud

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
In the maze of her imagination

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
You love this town

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Even if that doesn't ring true

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
You've been all over

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
And it's been all over you

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
It's a beautiful day

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Don't let it get away

01:45.000 --> 01:54.000
It's a beautiful day

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
Touch me

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
Take me to that other place

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
Teach me

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
I know I'm not a hopeless case

02:08.000 --> 02:15.000
[music]

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
See the world in green and blue

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
See China right in front of you

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
See the canyons broken by cloud

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
See the Bedouin fires at night

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
See the oil fields at first light and

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
after the flood all the colors came out

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
[aahhhhhh...]

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
It was a beautiful day

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Don't let it get away

02:56.000 --> 03:04.000
Beautiful day

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
Touch me

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Take me to that other place

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
Reach me

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
I know I'm not a hopeless case

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
What you don't have you don't need it now

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
What you don't know you can feel it somehow

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
What you don't have you don't need it now

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
You don't need it now

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
It was a beautiful day

03:37.000 --> 04:03.000
