[Intro]

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The heart is a bloom

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Shoots up through the stony ground

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
There's no room

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
No space to rent in this town

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You're out of luck

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And the reason that you had to care

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The traffic is stuck

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And you're not moving anywhere

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You thought you'd found a friend

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
To take you out of this place

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Someone you could lend a hand

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
In return for grace

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's a beautiful day

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Sky falls you feel like

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's a beautiful day

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Don't let it get away

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You're on the road

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But you've got no destination

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You're in the mud

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
In the maze of her imagination

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You love this town

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Even if that doesn't ring true

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You've been all over

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And it's been all over you

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's a beautiful day

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Don't let it get away

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's a beautiful day

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Touch me

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Take me to that other place

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Teach me

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I know I'm not a hopeless case

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
See the world in green and blue

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
See China right in front of you

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
See the canyons broken by cloud

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
See the Bedouin fires at night

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
See the oil fields at first light and

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
after the flood all the colors came out

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It was a beautiful day

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Don't let it get away

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Beautiful day

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Touch me

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Take me to that other place

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Reach me

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I know I'm not a hopeless case

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
What you don't have you don't need it now

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
What you don't know you can feel it somehow

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
What you don't have you don't need it now

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You don't need it now

0
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It was a beautiful day
